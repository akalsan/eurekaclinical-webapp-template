This project implements the basic classes and configurations that need to be in place for a eurekaclinical webapp project and serves as a working template project. The eurekaclinical-webapp-archetype is created off this project by running the below command. This project will be updated and used only if the eurekaclinical-webapp-archetype project needs to have a major update. Although the archetype can be updated directly, this option gives a chance to test the update before the archetype is created for it. 

*mvn archetype:create-from-project*

The archetype is created in the target/generated-sources/archetype folder.
